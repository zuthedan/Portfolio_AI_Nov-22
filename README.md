# Portfolio_AI_Nov-22
 
Welcome to this portfolio of mine

You will see, that this repository has three branches (apart from the main branch). Each of them is containing one project or one part of a project I chose to represent my skills and knowledge.

Let me give you a short explanation of what those projects are:

AI_Basics_Lessons:

	This is the Unity project I created to give my most recent AI-Basics lectures. 
	In these three lessons I showed the students, how the Unity NavMesh, a simple state machine and flocking behaviours are done.
	In addition to that I also talked about theoretical approaches to pathfinding, minimax and behaviour trees.

Behaviour Tree:
	
	Speaking of behaviour trees, this is part of a game jam project, where I decided to implement an AI by using a behaviour tree. 
	I already did the base nodes for an earlier project, so for this one I just had to do some minor changes to them.
	The leaf nodes were designed to create a kind of stalking behaviour for our planned horror game.
	Even though our team was not able to bring this production to an end, this project further improved my experiences with behaviour trees.
	
ConsoleChess_C++:

	My first major program while learning visual basic in school has been a simple chess program.
	This became a habbit for me. Whenever I learned a new object oriented laguage, I wrote a chess program with it.
	That way I could see whether I already got a good understanding of the syntax and other uniqueness the language had.
	This one is the program I wrote in my free time, while learning C++.
